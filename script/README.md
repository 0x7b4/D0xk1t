# D0xk1t

Thanks for all the support for the D0xk1t project. Throughout the next month and so,
I will be doing a complete rework of the D0xk1t framework, and I will be implementing
it not as a simple crappy Python script, but a full-fledged self-hosted web application
built with Flask. I was inspired by the design of many preexisting enterprise-level frameworks, including Nessus and Faraday, and wanted to do something similar.

This does not mean that D0xk1t is deprecated! The D0xk1t script will still be implemented, but the "core of the apple" will be the web-based client.

## Dependencies:

Python- _most Linux distros will have Python pre-installed_

* python-nmap  _still a work-in-progress_

* python-geoip  

* python-geoip-geolite2  

* re _for regular expressions, probably already installed_

* urllib2

* lxml

* smtplib

Git - _some distros have this already as well, but in case no, execute:_ `sudo apt-get install git`
