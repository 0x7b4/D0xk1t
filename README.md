###2.About
D0xing is seen by not only hackers, but the general population that has a grasp of computer technology as an activity deemed script-kiddish, malicious, harmful, etc.

The sole purpose I wrote this program was

1. To practice my [Python](https://python.org)

2. To allow other hackers to play around and experiment and also learn about how to protect themselves and others, as well as info gathering, and reconaissance.

3. Bring awareness to online privacy and protecting your identity.

4. Bring awareness to shutting the fuck up, script kiddies.

###3.How to use
Very simple. This program was written on a 64-bit Ubuntu machine, in Python 2. It's best to be running a Linux machine when using this.

####a.Dependencies:

Python- _most Linux distros will have Python pre-installed_

Git - _some distros have this already as well, but in case no, execute:_ `sudo apt-get install git`

A fucking brain - _thank you_

####_The follow dependecies can be installed using pip. If not, the program will automatically do it for you_

* python-nmap  __still a work-in-progress__

* python-geoip  

* python-geoip-geolite2  

* re __for regular expressions, probably already installed__

* urllib2

* lxml

* smtplib

#####b.How to install
OK in order to get D0xK1t, clone the repo
`git clone https://github.com/ex0dus-0x/D0xk1t`

#####c.Usage
First, change your directory into the repo
`cd /path/to/D0xK1t`
Then, execute
`python start.py`

You will be presented with a menu. Enter the option you want. That easy. Have fun getting roasted for your lousy D0x.
